## About Me
I am currently studying computer engineering at UC Davis. I love to see how the various forms of software

are used and implemented in our daily lives, and how they will evolve in this growing age of tech.

- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning and implementing the whole development cycle of websites and applications. So far, the MERN stack and Kotlin have been my main tools.

- ğŸ”­ My next goals are integrating my applications into the cloud, and getting better at React.

- ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to get an internship/opening position as a developer/engineer to expand my knowledge.

- ğŸ˜„ On my free time I enjoy spending time with my pets, reading manga, and learning Mandarin.
