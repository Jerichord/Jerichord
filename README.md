## About Me
I graduated computer engineering from UC Davis with extensive coding experience in various projects ranging from mock file systems to implementing code in machine

language, creating fullstack applications, and working on embedded systems. I am currently an SDE intern with interest in networking and fullstack. 

I love to see how the various forms of software are used and implemented in our daily lives, and how they will evolve in this growing age of tech.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m actively working on increasing knowledge on the whole development cycle of websites and applications. So far, the MERN stack and Kotlin have been my main tools.

- ðŸ”­ My next goals are integrating my applications into the cloud, and reading more on networking and system design.

- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to get an internship/opening position as a developer/engineer to expand my knowledge.

- ðŸ˜„ On my free time I enjoy spending time with my pets, reading manga, and learning Mandarin.
