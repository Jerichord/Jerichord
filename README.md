## About Me
I graduated computer engineering from UC Davis with extensive coding experience in various projects ranging from mock file systems to implementing code in machine

language, creating fullstack applications, and working on embedded systems. My most recent experience was a Software Quality Engineer in Broadcom. 

I love to see how the various forms of software are used and implemented in our daily lives, and how they will evolve in this growing age of tech.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m actively working on increasing my network knowledge, and developing in my free time.

- ðŸ”­ My next goals are getting deeper into the networking and development lifecycle through certs and projects.

- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to find a niche that I enjoy in the field.

- ðŸ˜„ On my free time I enjoy spending time with my pets, reading manga, and learning Mandarin.
